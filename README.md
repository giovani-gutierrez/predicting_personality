# Predicting Personality: Introvert or Extrovert?

Please visit [this website](https://giovani-gutierrez.github.io/projects/personality.html) for a much nicer looking final report!

## Description 

In this project, I use statistical/machine supervised learning methods to classify participants as either introverts or extroverts based on multiple features such as age, sex, posture type, and other measured personality traits.

The data used is from a [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0037450) conducted by Sylvain Guimond (San Diego University for Integrative Studies) and Wael Massrieh (McGill University).
